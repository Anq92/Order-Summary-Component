## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

It's my first project using SASS and also first time with media queries.

### Continued development

I tried to organize my code with SASS, but I'm sure it could be done better :D I will deepen my knowledge with future projects.


### Useful resources
